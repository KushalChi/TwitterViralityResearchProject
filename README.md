# TwitterViralityResearchProject

I initiated a research project in UCSC to analyze how Twitter virality behaves using Python, Tweepy, and Pandas.
I designed three Python bots that parse Twitter API using Tweepy to gather data on three sample Twitter accounts.
The results were then amalgamated into CSV files and I uploaded them to Pandas to create graphs to analyze the data.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
